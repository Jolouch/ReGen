                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness\nThe spec 1 allows remote monitoring and control of home temperature. The spec 2 allows reading the current temperature at the thermostat position. The spec 3 allows setting the thermostat temperature within 60°F to 80°F. Therefore, aspects of monitoring, controlling, and setting within a range seem covered, but the mention of one-degree increment adjustments is not resolved explicitly in the specifications.\nThis falls under S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved by the current specifications.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince this is S1, we go to Step 3.1. The incompleteness is the lack of specification for making adjustments to the thermostat settings in one-degree increments, which is part of the initial function description. It belongs to the action (constraint) incompleteness, as it lacks specification of the increment condition.",
