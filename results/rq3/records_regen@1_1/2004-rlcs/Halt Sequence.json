However, point 4 mentions that the status could change to 'open' as well without an operator's command. This specific scenario is missing from the current specifications. Even though it is plausible, it is not explicitly covered. Hence, the situation aligns with S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved.",

The incompleteness is related to the situation where the status of a closure device changes to 'open' without an operator's command after being previously closed. This is a case of branch coverage incompleteness, as an important situation is not defined.",
