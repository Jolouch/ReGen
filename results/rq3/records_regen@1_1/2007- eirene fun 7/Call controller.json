The system should contact the destination and display its functional identity to the controller.\n2. The functional identity includes necessary information.\n3.

Specifically, 'priority status' appears to be omitted in the context of assisting with establishing calls using functional identity.\nThus, there is action incompleteness since the priority status detail is absent.",
