Provide audible and visual alerts for incoming group or broadcast calls on the cab radio.\n2. Display the group identity of the voice group call.\n3. Automatically connect calls to the loudspeaker if the handset is not in use.\n4. Connect calls to the handset if it is off the hook.\n5.

Thus, this is an explicit absence (S1).",

This points to a lack of specification regarding the action of connecting calls to the handset when it is off the hook.\nThus, it is identified as action incompleteness because it lacks the operation of connecting to the handset.",
