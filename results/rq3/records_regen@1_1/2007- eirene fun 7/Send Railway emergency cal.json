                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness\nThe specification 1 covers the initiation of Railway emergency calls. Specification 2 addresses the logging of each event activation, termination, and any failures by the recorder. Specification 3 addresses the provision of a visual and audible alert when the emergency function is activated. However, there is no mention of alerts continuing until call termination instructions are followed. Hence, the continuous alert until termination is not fully addressed. This suggests it's an S2 scenario (implied absence).",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince we are dealing with an S2 scenario, we consider two perspectives:\n1. Hidden situations: Are there any additional conditions that need consideration? Yes, the continuation of visual and audible alerts until the call is completely terminated is not addressed.\n2. Actions sufficiency: Are actions involved in the function point sufficient? No, the alerts should continue until termination, and termination action and alert ceasing aren't mentioned. This points to branch coverage incompleteness since there is a lack of situation consideration.",
