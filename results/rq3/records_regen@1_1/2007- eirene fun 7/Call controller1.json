Contacting the destination and showing functional identity to the controller. 2. Functional identity must include necessary information. 3.

Specification 2 describes the contents of the functional identity, resolving function point 2. Specification 3 and 4 handle the audio-visual notifications to the driver, resolving function point 3. Also, they resolve function point 4 regarding the call connection. However, function point 5 concerning busy line or network issues seems partially resolved in specification 4, as there is no further elaboration of these indications.\nThis appears to be an S2 situation as the function points seem resolved but hint at missing specifics.",

No hidden condition initially appears overlooked, but the operation sequence provides new insight, especially the indication of busy line or network issues through notification. It seems the specifications do not detail the specific nature of these indications. The lack of clarity in how 'busy line or network issues' are communicated constitutes an action incompleteness as the specifications do not specify this aspect.",
