Initialization in Startup State. 2. Execution of Normal or Recovery Startup Mode based on prior software termination type.",
                "#step2: Step 2: Locate the incompleteness. The specifications seem to address the initialization (spec 1) and the presence of Normal or Recovery modes (spec 2, 3, and 4). However, the function description implies specific conditions for selecting Normal or Recovery mode depending on prior termination. The specification should explain how each mode is chosen, particularly Normal Mode, similar to how spec 4 details Recovery Mode. Therefore, we identify a situation of S2 (segment absence) as it appears specifications mention the execution of modes but might lack certain conditions or operations for clarity.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness. Given the S2 situation, we need to identify the absent element despite mentioned specifications. We note spec 4 covers Recovery Mode under specific conditions, but no specific condition mentions Normal Mode initiation after standard shutdown, as hinted in the operation sequence. This hints at a branch coverage incompleteness, focusing on the condition unexplored - the criterion for Normal Mode initiation, missing from the specifications.",
                "#step4: Step 4: Summary and decision. Based on the absent condition related to the start of Normal Startup Mode after a standard shutdown, we generate the new specification. The absent element is the situation for Normal Startup Mode initiation."
