Let's review the operation sequence for potential insights.\nIn the operation sequence, the first action 'remove projects when necessary' and the second and third actions regarding assigning items to projects suggest these might be frequently done tasks.\nWhile reviewing specifications, there is no explicit mention of 'remove projects' apart from the 'delete' function, which are conceptually different (removal might be more about archiving, not fully deleting).\nTherefore, there might be an implied absence around different actions involved in handling projects beyond what's defined as 'edit' or 'delete.'
