Reassessing specifications, everything is explicitly covered in terms of actions and situations outlined in the function points.\nLooking at the operation sequence for additional context, the sequence confirms feedback and retry when a mistake is made. However, I see no direct relation to plot direction changes or the switch to the ending scene. Thus, re-evaluating each specification, they all seem complete, rendering the operation sequence just a confirmation of already specified functions except for explicit integration of plot guides.\nI've found no concrete deficiency in detail here regarding either hidden situations or insufficient actions based on the given operation sequence."
