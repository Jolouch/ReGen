Considering the operation sequence, points 1, 2, and 3 about optimized and customized temperature settings, as well as unified temperature settings, appear consistent with the specifications. However, on reviewing the specifications, there's no explicit mention of optimizing temperature control across different areas (Point 1 of the operation sequence). This could imply a potential action incompleteness since ensuring optimal temperature control might require additional operational details or settings (e.g., balancing temperature between different thermostats).",

Thus, the new specification could encompass this required balance for optimal temperature control."
