The absence lies in the specific mechanism behind when to log failure after retries and how many retries are allowed before logging failure. \nNo hidden circumstance for retries exists, suggesting the action incompleteness related to the logging actions. Reviews and suggestions point that there might need to be regulating specifications on how many retries before a log entry classifies it as a 'failure'. This absence of a definite retrial condition and logging action might regulate it successfully post missing connection gap."
