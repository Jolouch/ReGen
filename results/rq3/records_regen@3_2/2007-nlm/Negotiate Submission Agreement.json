Partially covers point 5.\n- Spec 5: Able to store terms of agreements and use them to monitor/review/process submissions. Supports ongoing function.\n- Spec 6: Keeps an audit trail of all actions. Supports comprehensive management.\n\nAll function points appear to have been addressed by the specifications initially, leaning towards S2: implied absence.",

The specifications do not explicitly mention access levels.\n- Function point 5 (set periodic or ad-hoc submission schedules) is resolved by spec 3.\n- Function points 6 and 7 (manage and monitor submission volumes) are resolved by specs 4 & 5.\n- Function point 8 (keep an audit trail of all actions) is resolved by spec 6.\n\nThe function point related to users having permission to add/edit based on access levels seems to have been omitted.
