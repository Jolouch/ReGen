The parameters that can potentially be changed are 'deadline' and 'output directory'. It also highlights constraints: deadlines and cost are crucial and normally wouldn't be changeable unless it's a 'delayed deadline' or a 'different output directory'. Step 2: locate the incompleteness. Spec 1 ensures authorization, Spec 2 allows job cancellation, and Spec 3 handles revisions in scheduling upon job changes or deletions. The function point to cancel a job is covered by Spec 2, but the ability to change certain parameters is not fully addressed specifically, which suggests incompleteness. It seems this incompleteness belongs to S1 as there’s an explicit absence in specifications concerning parameter changes.",
