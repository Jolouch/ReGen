The point to inform the driver with indications of a busy line or network issues if unsuccessful, seems to be resolved by Specification 4. However, examining the operation sequence and function description, this function point might require more specific actions related to busy line or network issues, which aren't sufficiently covered by the current specifications.

Upon analyzing, we notice that Specification 4 doesn't explicitly differentiate between a busy line or network issues when the call is unsuccessful. While Specification 4 generally addresses failed call attempts, it doesn't provide specific details on busy line or network issues.\nAdditionally, the operation sequence highlights showing visual indications for a busy line and network issues. This aspect is not explicitly covered in the current requirements, suggesting action incompleteness in informing the driver with specific visual indications for busy line and network issues.",
