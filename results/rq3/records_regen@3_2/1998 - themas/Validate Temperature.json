However, the function point 4 about realizing the temperature setting if it's within range seems only partially addressed. The operation sequence mentions processing the thermostat's instructions if the setting is valid, but specifications do not cover it.\nThis falls under S1: There exists a function point clearly not resolved concerning further actions on valid temperature settings (i.e., processing thermostat's instructions).",
