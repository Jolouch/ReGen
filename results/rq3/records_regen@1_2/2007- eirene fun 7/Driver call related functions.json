Transfer sound to the handset and minimize loudspeaker volume when the handset is lifted. 3. Replace the handset to cancel the call or transfer communication back to the loudspeaker at its initial volume. 4. Provide a Push-To-Talk function for group calls.",
                "#step2: Step 2 involves examining whether each extracted function point is resolved by the specifications. Specification 1 covers point 1. Specifications 2 and 3 address parts of point 2 and point 3. Specification 4 covers point 4. However, it appears there is no explicit coverage for minimizing the loudspeaker volume when the handset is lifted. The operation sequence suggests minimizing the loudspeaker volume, which aligns with conditions mentioned in Step 1. Thus, this results in S2, as the points seem mostly resolved, but detail incompleteness exists in volume minimization.",
                "#step3: Since the situation is S2, we examine detail incompleteness. Specification 2 mentions transferring communication to the handset, but doesn't explicitly mention minimizing the loudspeaker's volume, which is a necessary aspect mentioned in the function description and supported by the operation sequence. Hence, an action incompleteness exists, lacking description of the loudspeaker volume minimization action when the handset is picked up.",

Given the requirement context and the absence of this detail, a new specification should be drafted to address minimizing the loudspeaker volume when the handset is picked up."
