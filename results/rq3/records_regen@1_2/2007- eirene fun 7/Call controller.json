Spec 2 specifies that functional identity includes train number, resolving function point 1 only partially as it doesn't cover 'necessary information'. Spec 3 covers notifying the driver and connecting the call to the loudspeaker. Spec 4 covers informing the driver about call failure.

This relates to action incompleteness, as the requirement lacks specific components of necessary information included in the functional identity.",
