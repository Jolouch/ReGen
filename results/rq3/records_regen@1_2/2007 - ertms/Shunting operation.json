Spec 2 talks about automatic transfer within speed limits. Spec 3 is about ETCS supervision to a speed limit, and Spec 4 addresses speed indication upon request. Spec 5 mentions the train trip function if a danger signal is passed.\nThe function points 1 through 4 seem to be resolved by current specifications. However, there’s a need to verify if driver confirmation in automatic Shunting and dynamic speed adjustments in safety conditions have been fully detailed.\nLet’s proceed with situation S2 as all main function points appear addressed.",

This is a potential action incompleteness because the necessary confirmation by the driver or real-time adjustments aren’t specified.",

Dynamic adjustment of Shunting speed based on safety should be considered. \nChoose one for the most probable absent element."
