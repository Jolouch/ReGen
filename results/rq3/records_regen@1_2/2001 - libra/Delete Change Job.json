Specification 2 addresses canceling a job and updating cluster status (function point 1 and 4). Specification 3 deals with revising scheduling decisions (function point 5). However, the function description discusses specific circumstances for changing parameters and mentions parameters critical to scheduling as not normally changeable except under specific conditions like different output directory or delayed deadline (function points 2, 6, and 7). These are not fully addressed in the specifications. This situation suggests an S1: explicit absence situation, as these important functional points are not reflected in the specifications.",

The incompleteness is related to the ability to change job parametersâ€”especially the allowance of changing certain parameters under specific conditions, which is not covered in current specifications. This suggests a branch coverage incompleteness: critical situations about changing parameters under stipulated conditions are missing.",
