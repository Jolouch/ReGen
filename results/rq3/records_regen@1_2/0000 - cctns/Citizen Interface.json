It is the S2(implied absence).",

Examine hidden conditions: The action of \"report crimes\", \"submit complaints\", and \"receive updates on the status of their cases in real-time\" in the sequence suggest that there might be missing elements. \n2. Evaluate actions sufficiency: current specs only cover conduit and information exchange/agreement, but not how citizens interact with the system for specific purposes, like reporting crimes or submitting complaints.\nThus, an action incompleteness exists: lack of explicit mention of how citizens can initiate interaction with police units for actions like reporting a crime or submitting a complaint."
