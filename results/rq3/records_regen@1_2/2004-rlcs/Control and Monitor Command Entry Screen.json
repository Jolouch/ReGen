The spec 2 addresses control permission, which is part of function point 1 but doesn't explicitly cover security levels. The spec 3 resolves setting the operational status for failed devices, which covers function point 2. The spec 4 displays information on active overrides, partially covering function point 3. However, none of the specifications explicitly mention control based on security levels, although the operation sequence indicates it's a significant aspect of the control functionality. This leads us to S1: There's a clearly missing specification regarding management based on security levels.",
