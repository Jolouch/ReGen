Specification 3 ensures the periodic evaluation occurs at least daily, addressing part of function point 2 concerning the periodic nature. Specification 4 logs the results, covering function point 3.

Reviewing the operation sequence, the actions mention 'flagging discrepancies' and 'escalating discrepancies'. The specifications lack addressing these actions. Hence, there is action incompleteness: absence of discrepancy handling actions."
