Alarm conditions are configurable.",

Let's examine if these function points are addressed by specifications: \n- Spec 1 covers the dynamic icon display. \n- Spec 2 addresses the audible alert and different icons for alarms.\n- Spec 3 provides an option to mute the audible alarm temporarily.\n- Spec 4 explains the automatic reversion of icons. \n- Spec 5 deals with configurable alarm conditions. \nThe function points seem to have been resolved by current specifications. It appears to be S2 (Implied Absence).",

Upon review, all conditions seem resolved, but let's consider operation sequence insights.\nThe operation sequence suggests customizing alarm types and priorities:\n- Set thresholds for alarm types\n- Define priority levels\n- Select notification preferences\nThe specifications don't reflect these customizations. The incompleteness is the absence of user-set thresholds and priority levels. It represents action incompleteness due to missing customization/priority functionalities."
