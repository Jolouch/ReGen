Users are logged out after a configurable timeout set by the System Administrator.",

Spec 4 addresses function point 4, configurable timeout for user logout.\\n\\nThere is an explicit absence (S1) regarding email alerts, as spec 2 mentions warnings but not the act of sending an email alert.",

The incompleteness lies in the lack of a specification for sending email alerts to the System Administrator after multiple failed login attempts. This constitutes an action incompleteness, specifically the absent action of sending an email.",
