Function point 3 is mentioned but not fully elaborated in any specification. Function point 4 is resolved by spec 3. Function point 5 is partially resolved by spec 5. It seems there is a missing specification covering the deactivation of accounts specifically with history. It falls under S1 because a function point is clearly not fully resolved.",
