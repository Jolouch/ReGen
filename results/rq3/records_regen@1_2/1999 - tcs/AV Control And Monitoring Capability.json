Allow manual or autonomous flight control and transfer control between systems. 3. Define preset limits including airspeed, altitude, and fuel. 4. Make an alert when out of limits to ensure safe operations.",
                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness\nSpec 1 addresses coordinating UAVs across the 5 levels of UAV interaction. Spec 2 addresses allowing manual/autonomous flight control. Spec 3 addresses transferring control between systems. Spec 4 addresses defining preset limits including airspeed, altitude, and fuel.\n\nAll function points seem to have some coverage in the specifications, but the alerting mechanism for when the UAV operates out of preset limits is not explicitly covered in any of the specifications. Thus, this could fall under the implied absence since Specs 1-4 are more about capabilities but do not cover the alert mechanism directly hinted at in the operation sequence.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince it's S2 (implied absence), I consider:\n1. Hidden Situations: Specs mention entering limits but lack the mechanism for alerting if these limits are exceeded. \n2. Necessary Actions: The operation sequence mentions alerting operators if limits are exceeded, which is a key action not present in the specs.\n\nThus, there is action incompleteness as the specification lacks this necessary alert operation.",
