Specs 2, 3, and 4 resolve function points related to call continuation, movement out of the group call area, and inability to connect. However, function point 5 involves informing the driver through visual indications when unable to connect, which is partially resolved since only audible indications are mentioned in the spec 4. Therefore, this is S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved.",

This is a branch coverage incompleteness, as it involves a situation not covered (informing the driver with visual indications when unable to connect).",
