Indication of supervised Shunting speed upon request.\n5. Application of train trip function if danger signals are passed.",

It is the S2 situation as no function point appears completely absent.",

The description refers to the 'confirmation from driver' needed for automatic transfer at specific speeds, so there's action incompleteness due to the lack of explicit specification of how the confirmation is obtained or processed.\n- Consider operation sequence 2 and 3, which imply the need for driver confirmation during the automatic transfer, adding action clarity to the sequence.",
