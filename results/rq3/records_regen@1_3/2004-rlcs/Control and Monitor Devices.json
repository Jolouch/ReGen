Spec 2 addresses the issuance of an audible alarm and altering the icon for alarm status. Spec 3 provides temporary muting of the audible alarm. Spec 4 covers automatic reversion of icons once the alarm is resolved. Spec 5 addresses configurability of alarm conditions.\nHowever, while temporary muting is covered, the functionality for permanently muting is not addressed in the specifications.\nSo, it is an S1 situation because there is a clear absence of specification for permanent muting.",
