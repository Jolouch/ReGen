Spec 2 is related to control permission, broadly touching on security levels. Spec 3 explicitly mentions setting the operational status of failed devices, covering function point 2. Spec 4 covers displaying information on active overrides, addressing function point 3. All main function points seem addressed by the specifications, suggesting an implied absence (S2).",

Reviewing the requirement context and operation sequence, notice that none of the specifications address managing security levels directly, which is mentioned both in the function description and operation sequence.
