Spec 2 provides a condition for halting based on a device's failure to report within the response time. Spec 3 provides another condition for halting based on the closure status change to unknown or closed. However, the function description introduces another situation for halting: the status change to open without an operator's command. This specific scenario is not accounted for in the current specifications.\nThus, it falls under S1 (Explicit absence). There is a functional point clearly not resolved.",

It is specifically the branch coverage incompleteness because it is related to an unconsidered situation.",
