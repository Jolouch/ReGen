Generate a table of 'one-way hash function' values for each control unit's non-volatile memory items. 2. Periodically verify computed 'Message Digest' values against development records and log results. There are additional implied actions related to identifying, resolving discrepancies, and storing results appropriately for future reference.",

There is no direct mention of action on discrepancies, such as identifying or resolving them, nor is there any explicit reference to storing results for compliance checks in the specifications.",

Given the context, the absence is related to action: there are actions implied by the operation sequence that are not covered by the specifications. Firstly, identifying and resolving discrepancies implies that the system should actively detect and handle issues with the Message Digest results but it isn't explicitly stated. Secondly, there is no mention of storing results for compliance checks, which is an action incompleteness. Since the focus here is on discrepancies and storage, these are action incompleteness issues.",
