The association of each investigation subject with exposure contacts, including unambiguous links across jurisdictions.\n2. The ability to trace, investigate, and monitor contacts of exposed entities (e.g., people, animals, places).\n3. Creation of new contacts from existing case records, including identification of contact types.\n4. Bidirectional linking between multiple contacts and cases.\n5.

Evaluate actions: While actions seem to be covered, reviewing the operation sequence reveals potential incompleteness in monitoring and managing contact exposure logs.\n\nThe operation sequence emphasizes the creation and management of logs for traced contacts, but the requirement specifications do not detail how logs should be handled or their status should be updated. This suggests action incompleteness related to log management and updates.",
