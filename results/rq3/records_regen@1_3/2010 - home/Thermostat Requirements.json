Let's review the function points against the given specifications:\n- Function Point 1 (Remote monitoring and control): Addressed in spec 1, where users can monitor and control temperature remotely.\n- Function Point 2 (Access current temperature reading): Covered in spec 2, which allows users to read the temperature at a thermostat position.\n- Function Point 3 (Adjust thermostat settings in one-degree increments within a range): While spec 3 covers setting the thermostat temperature range to between 60°F and 80°F, it does not explicitly mention adjustments in one-degree increments.\nSince there is no explicit specification for one-degree increments, this falls under Situation 1 (S1) - explicit absence.",

Since we identified Situation 1, we locate the incompleteness related to the explicit absence of functionality specifying the adjustment increments.
