The specifications do not explicitly mention user notifications or feedback mechanisms when errors are detected during validation, hence the actions might be incomplete.",

We proceed to Step 3.2 because the situation is S2.\n\nExamining existing specifications, existing specs address validation and configuration. Highlighted discrepancies are also covered. No hidden situations appear omitted directly within descriptions. \n\nHowever, in the operation sequence, the emphasis is placed on privilege-based rule configuration and rule-based validation accuracy. \n\nThe operation sequence indicates that user privilege distinctions are necessary for rule configuration. \n\nThe requirement specifications currently address user configuration of rules broadly but do not specify the privilege-based distinction.
