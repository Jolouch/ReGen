That is, while invalid temperatures are identified and a status is output, it's not clear (from the specs) if any further action is required regarding those invalid statuses (like logging for record-keeping or further particular response). This potential action (logging the invalid temperatures) is not outlined in the specifications but is reasonable for comprehensive validation.\nThus, action incompleteness exists because the specification lacks necessary operations concerning the next actions/data handling after identifying invalid temperatures."
