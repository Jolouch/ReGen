The operation sequence mentions several checks and diagnostics that are not explicitly included in the specifications. One potential incompleteness is that the specification doesn't mention performing initialization checks before determining the startup mode, which ties into ensuring system integrity and stability before initiating any mode. Thus, there is action incompleteness because the specification lacks necessary operations regarding system checks and diagnostics."

This suggests that an explicit specification regarding Normal Startup post-standard shutdown is missing.\nThus, there exists action incompleteness due to the lack of specification concerning the Normal Startup Mode initiation after a routine shutdown.",

The specification should explain how each mode is chosen, particularly Normal Mode, similar to how spec 4 details Recovery Mode.

This hints at a branch coverage incompleteness, focusing on the condition unexplored - the criterion for Normal Mode initiation, missing from the specifications.",
