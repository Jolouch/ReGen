Hence, there's implied absence (S2) about how results should actually display post-categorization or more details on matching term.",

However, letâ€™s consider insights from the operation sequence:\n- The operation sequence emphasizes offering an advanced search experience and ensuring efficiently relevant information. Although current specs cover result relevance by matched terms, there might be an implied completeness regarding advanced features that enhance user navigation or result interaction, such as tagging or saving searches.\n\nThis suggests action incompleteness: potentially lacking advanced function specification to enhance the user's search experience."
