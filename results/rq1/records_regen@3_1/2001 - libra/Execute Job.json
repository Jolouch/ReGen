The function point 3 mentions the stride-scheduling algorithm, which is more detailed in the operation sequence, so it's indirectly covered.

The segment seems covered but requires more detail from operation sequencing.",

The operation sequence doesn't cover another potential aspect: handling situations when multiple jobs have the same pass value. Determining this order is crucial but absent.",
