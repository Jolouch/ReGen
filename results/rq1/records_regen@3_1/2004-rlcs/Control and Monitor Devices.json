Specification 3 provides the option to mute the audible alarm temporarily, partially addressing function point 3. Specification 4 covers the automatic icon reversion after alarm resolution, addressing function point 4. Specification 5 covers configurable alarm conditions, addressing function point 5.\nHowever, the function description mentions the ability to mute alarms temporarily or permanently, but specifications only mention temporary muting (Specification 3).
