Spec 4 addresses function point 4's manual override capacities and reversion to schedule. Initial assessment shows all function points seem covered. So, it is the S2.",

Adequacy of described actions in covering the function's scope. Looking at the operation sequence, it highlights user customization, adjustment of settings, allowance for precise control, overriding current settings, and reversion to pre-set schedules. Reversion and scheduling are accounted for, but precise control or specific manual overrides aren't explicitly detailed in specs. The sequence's insights suggest potential refinement in manual setting operations for precision.",

Spec 4 covers manual settings and their persistence until reverting to a default setting. All function points in the description seem resolved in the specs. So this is an S2 situation.",
                "#step3: Step 3.2: Detect the specific incompleteness Since it's S2, I need to consider if there are hidden situations or inadequate actions from the specified function points. Reviewing the specs, no unconsidered hidden conditions are apparent. I will refer to the operation sequence to identify potential insights. The sequence suggests enabling users to customize the schedule (which specs cover) and make immediate adjustments to override settings. The sequence also mentions reverting to a pre-set schedule, which is mentioned in function specs. However, the sequence prompts for precise control and instant preset overrides but doesn't indicate confirming user actions during overrides. Thus, action incompleteness may be in confirming user-initiated override actions.",
