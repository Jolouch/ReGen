Action incompleteness: Review the operation sequence shows actions involving remote adjustment of settings in increments and precise control. These facilitate better thermostat usage but aren't reflected in current specifications.\n   \nFocusing on the operation sequence, action of adjusting thermostat settings remotely in one-degree increments aligns with specification 3 but isn't specifically stated as a remote operation.
