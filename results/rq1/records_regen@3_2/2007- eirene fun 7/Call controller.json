I notice that while specs describe what to do in both success and failure scenarios, there might be lack of emphasis on ensuring compatibility and including all necessary information for communication security, as seen in the operation sequence. None of the specs currently emphasize checking compatibility with digital radio standards. There's a branch coverage incompleteness about ensuring system-level checks for compatibility with digital radio standards."

This suggests there might be an improvement regarding the information in the functional identity beyond just the train number.\n\nTherefore, the incompleteness might be due to lack of specification on ensuring the functional identity provides comprehensive information necessary for secure communication, hence addressing potential action incompleteness.",
