The spec 1 covers point 1 by ensuring automatic tracking and storing of events. Spec 2 covers point 2 by maintaining audit trails at least as long as the case's lifetime. Spec 3 covers point 3 by ensuring data availability for inspection. Spec 4 addresses point 4 by enabling export of specified case trails. Spec 5 partially addresses point 5 by capturing and storing access violation attempts when access is denied. However, spec 5 does not mention validly attempted violations, and thus, there is an explicit absence of specification related to capturing validly attempted violations. So, this corresponds to situation S1.",
