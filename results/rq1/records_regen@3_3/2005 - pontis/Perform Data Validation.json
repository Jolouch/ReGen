Spec 4 allows configuring validation rules, addressing function point 2. Spec 5 provides a data review wizard for comparing bridge data, resolving function point 3.

The specifications cover several dimensions of the validation process but don't specify the feature of allowing privileged users to define specific validation parameters for single-field and cross-field checks as denoted in the operations. Thus, the gap lies in action incompleteness pertaining to privileged user capabilities. This action is crucial for personalizing validation conditions and parameters per user requirements.",
