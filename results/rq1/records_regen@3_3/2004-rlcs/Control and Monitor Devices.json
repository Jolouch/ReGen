Spec 4 covers automatic reversion of icons once the alarm is resolved. Spec 5 addresses configurability of alarm conditions.\nHowever, while temporary muting is covered, the functionality for permanently muting is not addressed in the specifications.\nSo, it is an S1 situation because there is a clear absence of specification for permanent muting.",

Examining the specs:\n- Spec 3 only mentions a temporary mute but says nothing about a permanent mute option, which aligns with the third step in the operation sequence that refers to 'mute the audible alarm temporarily or permanently.'\nTherefore, there is an action incompleteness pertaining to the permanent mute option.",
