Specification 2 involves the generation of the system event with specific details like event type and thermostat designation. However, the function point of 'record the event with timestamp and related details' is not fully covered by these specifications.\nThe specifications do cover the main function of generating an event, but there's no mention of recording the event with necessary details like the timestamp and the specific unit involved.\nThis points to situation S2: implied absence, where the function points seem resolved but there may be details missing that are implied by the operation sequence.",

While the main action of generating an event is covered, the operation sequence suggests recording the timestamp and the specific unit details, which is not addressed in the specifications.\nThus, there exists action incompleteness.
