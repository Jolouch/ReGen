Lead driver can establish a permanent radio connection among active vehicles lacking wire connections.\n2. A 'multi-drivers' indicator displayed on all cab radios.\n3. Notification mechanism for lead driver when a member places the call on hold.\n4. Lead driver can remove members and terminate the call.\n5.
