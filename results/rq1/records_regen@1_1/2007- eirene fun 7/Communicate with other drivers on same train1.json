Routing calls to the loudspeaker if the handset is on-hook in every cab. 3. Integration of controller into the multi-driver call. 4. Automatic addition of the controller when the call is initiated by the controller. 5. Display of controller's identity in the lead cab when the controller initiates a call.",

Specification 2 addresses function point 2 regarding routing calls to the loudspeaker. Specification 3 covers function points 3 and 4, concerning the integration of the controller, either initiated by the lead driver or the controller. However, specification 3 does not explicitly mention the display of the controller's identity in the lead cab when initiated by the controller.\nThis leads to S2, as all function points seem covered, but there may be an implied absence.",

Reviewing the operation sequence reveals a missing explicit specification for displaying the controller's identity, a crucial part of call initiation by the controller, which is stated in the function description. Hence, there is an action incompleteness due to the absence of a plan to display the controller's identity in the lead cab.",
