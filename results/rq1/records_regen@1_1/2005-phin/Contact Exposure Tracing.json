Associate investigation subjects with exposure contacts, including cross-jurisdiction links.\n2. Trace, investigate, and monitor contacts.\n3.

Since it's an S2, we check for hidden situations or action incompleteness. \n- No new specific situations in the function points are apparent.\n- Let's assess the operation sequence for new insights. The sequence emphasizes custom actions and alerts:\n  - There is an action 'send timely alerts to involved parties', which does not seem to be covered by existing specifications.\n\nThis suggests action incompleteness - the current specifications lack an operation for alerting involved parties, an essential step for effective monitoring and tracing.",
