Specification 4 handles the logging of verification results.\nAll function points appear to be covered by the specifications. It suggests an implied absence - S2.",

The current specifications cover logging but not handling or alerting for discrepancies.\nThus, there is a potential for action incompleteness in alerting system operators when there are discrepancies between current and historical 'Message Digest' values.",
