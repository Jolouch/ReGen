Audible alert and color-shifted icon appear in case of alarms. 3. Option to mute the audible alert temporarily or permanently. 4. Icons revert automatically once alarm is resolved. 5. Alarm conditions are configurable.",

Spec 3 and 4 handle the option to temporarily mute (part of function point 3) and reverting of icons (function point 4), and spec 5 deals with function point 5. However, spec 3 does not cover permanent mute as mentioned in the function description. This indicates an explicit absence (S1) since the need for permanent mute functionality is clearly described but not covered in the current specifications.",
