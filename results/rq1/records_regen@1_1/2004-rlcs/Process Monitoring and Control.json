Spec 4 specifies command execution with valid status of sensors, resolving function point 4.\nNo explicit function points are unresolved: this is S2.",

The operation sequence, however, suggests managing and adjusting operational parameters based on sensor status. This implies a need for automatic adjustment, which has not been clearly defined in the specifications.\nTherefore, there is action incompleteness: the specifications lack action on automatic adjustment of operational parameters based on sensor status.",
