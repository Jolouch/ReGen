This suggests an S2 situation where the function points appear resolved by specifications.",

Considering action incompleteness, I will refer to the operation sequence: it suggests transitions between modes but the specifications are not explicit about prohibiting simultaneous mode operation. The function description states modes cannot run simultaneously, but this action does not appear explicitly resolved by the specifications. Potential action incompleteness exists about ensuring mutual exclusivity of modes.",
