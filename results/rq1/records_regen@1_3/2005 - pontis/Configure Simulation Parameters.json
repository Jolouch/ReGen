Thus, it is the S2 situation. ",

Are the actions detailed sufficiently?\nBased on the function description and operation sequence, the need to modify simulation rules is implicitly suggested and could constitute action incompleteness. The specifications cover model parameters but do not mention simulation rules specifically.\nThus, there exists action incompleteness: the specification lacks modifications for simulation rules.",
