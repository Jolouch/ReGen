Specification 2 resolves function point 4, stating users can edit and remove structures.\n3. Specification 3 resolves function point 5 with marking and filtering of bridge statuses.\n4. Specification 4 resolves function point 6 by supporting design and preconstruction management.\n5.

The operation sequence mentions user privileges affecting global renumbering, but the specifications do not explicitly state how user privileges tie into this renumbering function.\n2. Are actions sufficient? Specifications do not clarify how user privileges are evaluated or managed, which should be associated with bridge key renumbering.\nThus, there's a potential action incompleteness because the evaluation or enforcement of user privileges regarding bridge key renumbering needs explicit definition in specifications.",
