Placement of thermostats (up to eight) in the home. 2. Individual or collective control of thermostats. 3. Support for scheduling up to twenty-four one-hour settings per day per week for each thermostat. 4. Manual settings that persist until the end of the scheduled time and then revert to default.",

Specification 2 addresses individual or collective control, covering function point 2. Specification 3 supports scheduling, addressing function point 3. Specification 4 related to manual settings persisting and then reverting to default addresses function point 4. Hence, all function points appear to be resolved by the current specifications, indicating an S2 situation.",

Considering the operation sequence, points 1, 2, and 3 about optimized and customized temperature settings, as well as unified temperature settings, appear consistent with the specifications. However, on reviewing the specifications, there's no explicit mention of optimizing temperature control across different areas (Point 1 of the operation sequence). This could imply a potential action incompleteness since ensuring optimal temperature control might require additional operational details or settings (e.g., balancing temperature between different thermostats).",

Considering the need for optimized temperature control mentioned in the operation sequence, it becomes evident there's an action-related incompleteness related to balancing or optimizing temperature across different thermostats. Thus, the new specification could encompass this required balance for optimal temperature control."
