Records security breaches with specific dates and times. 3. Indicates any non-operational periods of the Digital Home (DH) System.",

Specification 2 addresses daily average, maximum, and minimum temperature and humidity for each thermostat and humidistat. Specification 3 addresses security breaches. Specification 4 addresses non-operational periods. \nEach function point appears resolved by the specifications, but we must ensure there are no implied absences, as all function points seem covered.\nHence, it falls under situation S1, with the initial look indicating the specifications seem complete.",

Since it's an S1 situation, we must now ensure every detailed function aspect is considered. \nReviewing each specification again, it appears that the report generation for non-operational periods, as described in the function description, is not explicitly covered, aside from the operation sequence providing this insight. Thus, there seems to be a branch coverage incompleteness, specifically about detailing non-operational periods in the month report. The absence of a detailed specification indicating 'when the DH System was non-operational' is clearly evident."
