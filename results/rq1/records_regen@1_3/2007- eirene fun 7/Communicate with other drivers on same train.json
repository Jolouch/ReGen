Establish a permanent radio connection between multiple active traction vehicles lacking wire connections. \n2. Display a 'multi-drivers' indicator on all cab radios.\n3. Notify the lead driver if a group member places the call on hold.\n4. Allow the lead driver to remove members and terminate the call.\n5.

This represents an S1(Explicit absence) because one of the points (function point #6) is not covered by the specifications.",

This is a branch coverage incompleteness as a specific situation is not covered.",
