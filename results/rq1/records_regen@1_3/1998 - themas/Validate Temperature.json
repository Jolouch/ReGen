The spec 2 and spec 3 resolve part of function point 2 by comparing the current temperature against the valid range and handling it if invalid. Spec 4 and spec 5 resolve part of function point 2 and all of function point 3 by comparison of the temperature setting against the valid range. \nUpon reviewing all specifications, the function points are adequately addressed in terms of recognition, comparison, and invalid status output. There seems to be no explicit absence. However, there is an opportunity to gain new insights from the operation sequence. So this is S2.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince this belongs to S2, I'll consider if there are hidden situations or actions not covered. Upon reviewing the sequences, an implied absence is more apparent: there's no explicit specification dealing with the valid status. \nWhile the specifications cover the invalid outputs thoroughly, the operation sequence hints at a potential gap by not detailing the action or status for when temperatures are indeed valid. Therefore, there is an implied action incompleteness in the specification regarding responses to valid temperatures.",
