Create new contacts from existing case records and identify contact types. 4. Support bidirectional linking between multiple contacts and cases. 5.

Reviewing the descriptions and specifications suggests that the primary functions are covered. Thus, it seems to be S2 (Implied absence).",

Specifying detailed coordination methods between public health officials (related to function point 7).\n  2. Emphasizing systematic tracking and maintaining records of investigation status and outcomes (related to function point 8).\n\nThe action of maintaining records tracking investigation progress is critical and comprehensive in both output and future anticipations.
