The specifications do not explicitly mention access levels.\n- Function point 5 (set periodic or ad-hoc submission schedules) is resolved by spec 3.\n- Function points 6 and 7 (manage and monitor submission volumes) are resolved by specs 4 & 5.\n- Function point 8 (keep an audit trail of all actions) is resolved by spec 6.\n\nThe function point related to users having permission to add/edit based on access levels seems to have been omitted.
