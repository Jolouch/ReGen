Function point 2 is resolved by spec 2 and 3. \nHowever, the function description mentions naming the document, which is not addressed in any specification.\nThe incomplete function points clearly reveal an absence of specification related to naming the document.\nThis is situation S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved.",
