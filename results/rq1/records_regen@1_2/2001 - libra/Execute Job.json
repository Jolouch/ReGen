The process of actually executing jobs ('deciding how to time-slice') is not directly addressed, suggesting possible action incompleteness.\nBy referring to the operation sequence, the need to ensure job readiness based on priority and resources (operation 1) highlights missing details of job execution readiness and management, leading to possible deficiency in action completeness."
