Specification 3 provides continuous visual and short audible indications resolving part of function point 3.\nAll the functional points appear to be considered in the specifications; it might be an S2 case of implied absence.",

One area to explore is the operation sequence's reference to ensuring immediate communication, which isn't explicitly covered in the current specs. Immediate establishment of communication at call initiation is inferred but not detailed, potentially suggesting action incompleteness."
