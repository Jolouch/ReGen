Specification 3 permits setting temperatures within a specified range. Thus, these cover the function points of remote monitoring, accessing temperature, and setting within a range. While all function points appear to be resolved by current specifications, the operation sequence suggests more actions such as precise control and remote adjustment in increments, indicating S2.",

The action of remote adjustment in increments is noted multiple times and implies a need for precise control of temperature in increments, which isn't explicitly highlighted in current specifications. This indicates action incompleteness â€“ lacking specific emphasis on remote incremental adjustment.",
