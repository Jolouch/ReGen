                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness The spec 1 resolves the function point related to the placement of thermostats. The spec 2 relates to individual or collective control, matching the function description. Spec 3 correlates with the scheduling function point. Spec 4 covers manual settings and their persistence until reverting to a default setting. All function points in the description seem resolved in the specs. So this is an S2 situation.",
                "#step3: Step 3.2: Detect the specific incompleteness Since it's S2, I need to consider if there are hidden situations or inadequate actions from the specified function points. Reviewing the specs, no unconsidered hidden conditions are apparent. I will refer to the operation sequence to identify potential insights. The sequence suggests enabling users to customize the schedule (which specs cover) and make immediate adjustments to override settings. The sequence also mentions reverting to a pre-set schedule, which is mentioned in function specs. However, the sequence prompts for precise control and instant preset overrides but doesn't indicate confirming user actions during overrides. Thus, action incompleteness may be in confirming user-initiated override actions.",
