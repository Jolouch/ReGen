This resolves function point 2 and part of function point 3.\nSpec 2 handles retrying unresponsive requests and automatically requesting status again, which addresses function point 1.\nHowever, although the retry and defensive mechanisms are covered, the predetermined retries and failure logging's detailed approach isn't covered in the specifications which indicates situation could be S1 or S2.\nGiven the context of step 1 and step 2, the function point involving logging after a certain number of retries is implied absent from these specifications. \nIt indicates S2 because there's partial implication of logging and retry but no specific condition (e.g., number of retries).",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince it is S2, we deal with trailing details. The absence lies in the specific mechanism behind when to log failure after retries and how many retries are allowed before logging failure. \nNo hidden circumstance for retries exists, suggesting the action incompleteness related to the logging actions. Reviews and suggestions point that there might need to be regulating specifications on how many retries before a log entry classifies it as a 'failure'. This absence of a definite retrial condition and logging action might regulate it successfully post missing connection gap."
