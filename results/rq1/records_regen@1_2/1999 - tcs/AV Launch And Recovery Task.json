This translates into the following function points: 1. automatic launch and recovery; 2. cues for the operator; 3. capability to abort operations; 4. interoperability with IBLS and CARS.",

The spec 2 provides cues for the operator, addressing function point 2. The spec 3 ensures interoperability with IBLS and CARS, addressing function point 4. However, there is no specification addressing the capability to abort operations (function point 3). Therefore, this is situation S1, where a function point is clearly not resolved.",

This is a branch coverage incompleteness because it lacks the situation where operations need to be aborted.",
