But the specification mentions only the frequency and duration, omitting the continuous output until resolution.\nReferring to the operation sequence, there’s an action of continuously outputting alarm signals until resolution.\nIt indicates action incompleteness as the specifications don’t fully describe when the alarm signals stop."
