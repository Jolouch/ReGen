Spec 2 and 4 handle the comparison of current temperature and setting with the valid range. Spec 3 and 5 identify invalid temperatures and output invalid status, but they only describe actions for invalid temperatures.\n\nNow, examining the operation sequence: action 1 suggests realizing the current temperature if valid, which is not covered in any specifications. The specifications mainly focus on invalid temperatures, without detailing what happens with valid ones.\nThis implies the S2 situation: all function points appear resolved, but with a lack of detailed action for a valid current temperature.",

Specs address invalid temperatures, but operation sequence suggests realizing the current temperature if valid. There's an absence of specification for realizing a valid current temperature, suggesting action incompleteness.\n\nThis is aligned with action incompleteness because there is no specification detailing the necessary operation: the realization of valid current temperature.",
