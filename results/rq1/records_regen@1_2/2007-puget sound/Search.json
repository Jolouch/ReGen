Spec 2 addresses the dedicated search page. Spec 3 covers filtering functions. Spec 4 addresses categorizing search results. Spec 5 resolves directing to corresponding pages. Spec 6 covers the possibility of internet search extension. \nAll function points seem to be resolved by the current specifications, thus it is S2 (Implied absence). \n\nStep 3: Detect the specific incompleteness.\nSince this is S2, we examine hidden situations or insufficient actions. \nNo hidden situations appear to be missing. \nReviewing the operation sequence, I noticed a repeated emphasis on efficient filtering and sorting by relevance using specific criteria, suggesting action details might be needed.\nWhile spec 4 states categorization by relevance, it does not specify the granularity or criteria for relevance determination. This could suggest an action incompleteness related to the detailed implementation of sorting by relevance.\n\nStep 4: Summary and Decision.\nAbsent element: Details on how relevance for categorizing search results is determined.",
