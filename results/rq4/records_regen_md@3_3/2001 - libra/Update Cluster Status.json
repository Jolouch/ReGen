However, let's consider the operation sequence for new insights.\nThe operation sequence is similar to spec 1, which reserves resources before a job starts. There is no new insight indicating any missing action or situation based on the operation sequence. Therefore, no action incompleteness is detected.\nHowever, while examining potential conditions, I noticed the absence of actions regarding what to do if the resource reservation is unsuccessful.
