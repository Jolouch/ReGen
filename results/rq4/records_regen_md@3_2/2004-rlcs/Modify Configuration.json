The spec 2 covers the display of affected devices or workstations (function point 3). The spec 3 partially covers device rule configuration, yet it lacks the additional login password requirement (part of function point 2). Spec 4 covers adding or removing devices from the display (function point 4). Spec 5 covers modification of the facility map (function point 5). Hence, the incompleteness is related to the device rule configuration security, indicating an explicit absence (S1).\n\nStep 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince it's S1, we go to Step 3.1. The incompleteness is related to the lack of security (additional login password) for configuring device rules, which is an action incompleteness (missing constraint).\n\nStep 4: Summary and Generation\nBased on the requirement context and the absence of a security measure (additional login password) for configuring device rules, generate the new spec:\nThe GUI shall require an additional login password to configure device rules."
