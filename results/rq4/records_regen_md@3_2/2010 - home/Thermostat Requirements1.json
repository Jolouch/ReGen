However, they do not explicitly state the action of reverting to the default setting after the scheduled period ends.\n\nReviewing the operation sequence, it reinforces that manual temperature settings should remain in effect until the next scheduled setting takes over, but does not clarify if it should revert to a default setting if no new scheduled setting is available.\n\nThis indicates an action incompleteness: the action of reverting to the default setting after the scheduled ends is missing.",
