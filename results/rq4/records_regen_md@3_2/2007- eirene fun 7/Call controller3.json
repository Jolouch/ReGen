Let's get new insights from the operation sequence.\nI noticed the fourth action in the sequence: inform the driver to try again later or seek alternative communication methods if the call was not received by the controller. This is a reasonable absence because the requirement mentions notifying the driver of unsuccessful call reception, but it does not specify further actions for the driver.\nConsequently, there is action incompleteness, as the specification lacks detailed instructions for the driver when a call fails to connect."
