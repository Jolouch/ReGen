Also, quick recovery and business continuity are mentioned, which draws attention to the adequateness of the current specifications in addressing recovery processes fully.\n\nLooking specifically at the actions: Specification 3 does not explicitly mention recovery itself, only preparation steps like backup and storage are outlined, but not the active recovery operation. This might signify an action incompleteness, as the disaster recovery capability in its entirety should inherently include the recovery process itself.",
