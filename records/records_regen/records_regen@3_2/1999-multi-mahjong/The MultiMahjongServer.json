From the operation sequence, we observe that there's a dedicated action 'allow the administrator to view log information', which is not explicitly mentioned in the specifications, although it is alluded to in the function description and operation sequence.\nThis omission suggests an action incompleteness related to the function of providing log information to the administrator.",
