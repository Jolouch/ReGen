However, the difference in handling nonfatal errors isn't fully specified. \nThe operation sequence mentions providing a link to troubleshooting guide and allowing the game to continue. This suggests that while handling nonfatal errors appears to be partially implied in the operation sequence, the current specifications do not explicitly cover the continuation of the game. \nAll function points appear to be resolved except the handling of nonfatal errors which is not fully detailed.
