The spec 2 allows reading the current temperature at the thermostat position. The spec 3 allows setting the thermostat temperature within 60°F to 80°F. Therefore, aspects of monitoring, controlling, and setting within a range seem covered, but the mention of one-degree increment adjustments is not resolved explicitly in the specifications.\nThis falls under S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved by the current specifications.",

The incompleteness is the lack of specification for making adjustments to the thermostat settings in one-degree increments, which is part of the initial function description. It belongs to the action (constraint) incompleteness, as it lacks specification of the increment condition.",
