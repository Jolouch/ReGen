Additionally, it lacks specification on error handling or providing feedback.\n- Map: No error handling or messages for map-related actions or constraints on how many projects can be selected at once.\nThe operation sequence highlights narrowing search results and selecting projects on a map, which suggests functionality might be missing to provide feedback when options are not supported."
