The function point 'export specified case trails' is mentioned by spec 4.\n5. The function point 'capture access control violations' is mostly covered by spec 5, however, it focuses on storing violations of denied access, but doesn't fully address valid violations causing alerts.\nAll function points are nearly covered by the specifications, so it is case 2.",

No further actions are required initially. However, focusing on the operation sequence, specifically the action—‘capture and log access control violations’ implies a need for capturing validly occurred violations, which may include generating alerts for those violations, beyond simply storing them. The current specification regarding violation capturing doesn't fully encapsulate this.\nThis reveals action incompleteness: the warning or alert for valid access violations is missing.",
