Communication is enabled once a call is established (Condition and Action). 2. Transferring sound to the handset when it is lifted (Action and Object). 3. Minimizing loudspeaker volume when handset is lifted (Action and Constraint). 4. Canceling call or transferring communication to loudspeaker when handset is replaced (Condition and Action). 5. Availability of Push-To-Talk function during group calls (Condition and Action).",

Specification 3 resolves the function point 4. Specification 4 resolves the function point 5. However, Specification 3 partly resolves function point 4, but there is no explicit resolution for function point 3 (minimizing loudspeaker volume when handset is lifted) in the specifications.",

Since the incompleteness belongs to S1 (explicit absence), the uncovered function point is the action of minimizing loudspeaker volume when the handset is lifted. It is an action incompleteness because the specifications lack a necessary operation related to loudspeaker volume adjustment.",
