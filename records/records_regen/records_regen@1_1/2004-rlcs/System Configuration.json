Thus, all function points seem initially resolved, suggesting S2 (implied absence).",

While specifications cover access, modification, and security assignments, potential incompleteness lies in ensuring passwords are involved in security; the function description and specs highlight security levels without explicit password management. Reviewing the operation sequence, specifically steps 9 and 10 (control access based on roles and allow modifications of staff passwords), suggests an action incompleteness related to password management.",
