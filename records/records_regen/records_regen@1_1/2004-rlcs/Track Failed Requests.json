Specification 2 partially resolves function point 1 by mentioning a retry. However, it does not specify what happens if responses are continually unresponsive, nor does it mention a stopping condition based on retry limits. This suggests that the specifications only partially resolve the function points. This is situation S1, where the specification is missing elements to fully resolve the detailed function points.",
