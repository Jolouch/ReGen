The spec 4 addresses unplanned power interruption leading to Recovery Startup Mode.\nAll function points seem to be covered by the specifications.

Upon review, the function description mentions Normal or Recovery modes based on prior software termination. However, the specification does not explicitly address a scenario for entering Normal Start-Up Mode. This indicates a branch coverage incompleteness where a situation (i.e., condition for Normal Startup Mode) is not explicitly covered in the specifications."

Specification 2 resolves function point 2 by detailing the modes in Startup State. Specification 3 connects the startup mode with the software's termination type, addressing function point 3. Specification 4 specifies conditions leading to Recovery Mode, addressing function point 4 partially, as it covers unplanned interruption and abnormal termination but not normal termination.\nThe incompleteness is S1, since function point 4 related to normal termination is not explicitly specified.\n\nStep 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nStep 3.1: For S1, the function specification lacks a definition for the Normal Startup Mode in scenarios where the software termination was normal, suggesting branch coverage incompleteness."
