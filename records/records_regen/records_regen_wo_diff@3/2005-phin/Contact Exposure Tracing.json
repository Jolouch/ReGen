Condition Coverage: The specifications do not mention whether the tracing, investigating, and monitoring of contacts includes a feedback mechanism for when new information on contacts (e.g., symptom changes, test results) is obtained.\n\n2. Action Completeness: While the function points seem covered, actions involved in 'monitoring' contacts could lack sufficient details about the method of monitoring or how the system reacts to updates (e.g., real-time alerts or periodic reports).\n\nNeither the operation sequence nor the initial specifications address how the monitoring takes place or is reported, which appears to be a reasonable incompleteness from both condition and action perspectives.",
