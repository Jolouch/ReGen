It seems to address the update of queue status for both function points, indicating S2: all function points seem to have been resolved by current specifications.",

However, the focus on updating the queue status could imply a need for some form of notification or log that tracks these update events, which the provided specifications do not mention. This can be an action incompleteness.",

The spec 2 updates the execution host queue status when a job is scheduled for execution or removed. Therefore, the function points seem to be resolved: resources are reserved before scheduling, and queue status is updated when scheduling or removing a job. It indicates implied absence (S2).",

All situations appear resolved given both starting and ending job states are addressed. 2. There appears to be no action incompleteness at first glance. \nLet's use the operation sequence for further insights: Since the operation sequence is not provided, it cannot influence decision-making.\nHowever, during the transition between jobs (state change), there could be a need for temporary logging or escalation in priority if resource thresholds are approached, which are not covered in the original specifications."
