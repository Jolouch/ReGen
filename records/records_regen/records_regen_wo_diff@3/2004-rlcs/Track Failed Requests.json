Given that the function point is covered, this is S2 (implied absence) since function points appear to be resolved by the specifications.",

Upon reviewing the current specifications, spec 2 appears to discuss the retry mechanism adequately, covering necessary actions when a status is not received. No hidden conditions seem to be immediately apparent from the description itself. Spec 1 handles the tracking part.\n\nLet's speculate if there's a possible incompleteness by considering whether anything might be omitted. The operation sequence might suggest a step that isn't presently included, though it's omitted here. This lack of sequence suggests we evaluate the inherent steps.\n\nAn implied absence can be inferred if the specifications lack a confirmation response back to ensure the request is either successfully retried or provide a maximum retry limit to prevent endless loops.\n\nThis could be an action related to the handling of retriesâ€”ensuring confirmation feedback or retries are not infinite might be missing. It ends on implied action incompleteness regarding whether retries have any constraints.",

The spec 2 automatically requests the status again if not received.\nHere, the function point of retrying unresponsive requests is partially resolved by spec 2, as it mentions the retry mechanism but does not fully elaborate on all possible scenarios or necessary actions for retrying.\nThus, it is S2: the function points seem to have been all resolved by the function specifications, but more details are likely missing.",

For example, handling retries in case of repeated failures or conditions leading to a final failure condition after several unsuccessful attempts.\nUpon reviewing potential actions and conditions, one reasonable incompleteness is the absence of a final action for when repeated retries fail. There is no specification to handle a scenario where the request continuously goes unresponsive after multiple retries. This indicates branch coverage incompleteness due to unaddressed final failure handling after retries.",

The spec 2 describes re-requesting status if not received, addressing function point 3. However, specification 2 fully resolves function point 1, since it involves retrying unresponsive requests. \nThere's no explicit absence in the main function points, so it seems like an S2 case.",

Reviewing action steps, perhaps a missing action could involve notifying an operator about the failed requests during retry processes. This is not about generating a new request alone but aware of continuous failures. The incompleteness is action incompleteness regarding alerting relevant system operators when retries occur."
