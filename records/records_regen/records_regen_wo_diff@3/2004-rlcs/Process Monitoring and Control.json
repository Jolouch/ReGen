Spec 4 covers execution of commands requiring valid status for device sensors (function point 4). All function points appear resolved by current specifications, leading to situation S2 (Implied absence).",

Upon reviewing the requirements and considering the possibilities for branch coverage, there seems to be an implicit assumption that device sensors will always be controllable and their status checkable as presumed. However, there is no specification regarding what should happen if a device sensor status is invalid or unreachable. There is also no specification addressing the scenario if monitoring fails or communication with a sensor is lost. This is action incompleteness."

The description implies control but lacks details on operational limits or exceptions, which isn't entirely clear."

However, considering the critical nature of a railway control system, it is crucial to have a fail-safe mechanism in place if a device sensor reports an invalid status. This situation is not explicitly covered in the specifications, pointing towards a potential omission in addressing fault management."
