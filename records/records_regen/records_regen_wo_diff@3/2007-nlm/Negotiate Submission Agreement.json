Manage negotiation status and written submission agreements, maintaining schedules. 2. Allow users to add or edit agreement terms based on access level. 3. Allow setting submission schedules, periodic or ad-hoc. 4. Manage and monitor submission volumes. 5. Store terms of agreements, and use them for monitoring, review, or processing submissions. 6.

                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nGiven situation S2, we examine if there are hidden situations or insufficient actions. The mention of access levels for modifying agreements suggests a potential gap. The requirement does not specify how access levels affect the ability to add or edit agreement terms. This suggests a branch coverage incompleteness related to the access level condition. This may imply that there are different scenarios for different user levels, which the current specifications do not address.",
                "#step4: Step 4: Summary and Decision\nThe absence lies in the specification of conditions under which different user access levels can edit or add agreement terms. This lack of explicit mention of access level conditions points toward a branch coverage incompleteness. Therefore, we need a specification addressing how access levels influence the ability to negotiate submissions agreements."

However, the action of setting periodic or ad-hoc submission schedules (point 4) is not covered by a specification describing how users, based on access level, can add or edit agreement terms. Additionally, specification lacks access level control to manage who can add or edit terms, relating to point 3 of function points.",
