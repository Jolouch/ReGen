Spec 2 handles requests to turn on units, determining whether to honor them or queue them. Spec 3 handles requests to turn off units. The function point related to limiting the number of active units appears addressed, but control over each unit is only implied.

Action incompleteness could exist since while specifications detail turning on/off and queuing, they don't declare how to ensure overall control of units (e.g., abort or restart control sequences). The context implies complete control, so actions might lack depth, especially regarding control adjustments."
