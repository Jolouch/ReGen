Evaluate actions: considering that alarm events should be used for reports, there is no explicit mention of how to utilize these events in the specification. Additionally, audio alerts are well-defined for both types of alarms.\nSince the recording of alarm events is mentioned for reports, yet the method or specifics of these reports are not described, we suspect reporting process might be missing details, but there is no immediate operation sequence to gain new insights from.\nThe function point 2 states that recorded events are used for operational and statistical reports, indicating the need for a reporting mechanism."
