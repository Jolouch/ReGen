Specification 2 includes event type and thermostat designation in the event. However, the function description mentions 'subsequent record' which is not directly resolved in the specifications.\nThis is situation S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved, a deficiency in the specification related to the 'subsequent record' of the event.",

This relates to function point 2.\n- The spec 2 specifies the event will describe the event type and include thermostat designation, which corresponds to function point 3.\n- The function point 1 about the request being denied is implicitly part of starting conditions but not explicitly covered.\n- All function points appear resolved through the given specifications, so this falls under S2.",

Missing aspect found here can be the absence of specifics on whether the event generation involves a detailed timestamp or source.",
