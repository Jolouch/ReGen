Search results are categorized based on relevance determined by matched terms numbers. 5. Clicking on a search result navigates to the corresponding page. 6.

The description mentions 'relevance' based on 'matched terms numbers,' but doesn't specify how tied terms in relevance scores are handled or if other relevance metrics are considered.\nThis implies a gap in sufficient criteria for categorizing search results, indicating action incompleteness.",
