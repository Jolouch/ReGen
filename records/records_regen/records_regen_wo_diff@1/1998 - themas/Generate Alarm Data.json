Assess if any conditions are missing: \n   - The conditions of triggering an alarm are well-covered: invalid temperature and temperature exceeding limits.\n   - Possible missing condition: actions upon resolution of the alarm or end of alarm event process.\n2. Consider if actions are sufficient: \n   - Actions in terms of alarm sound generation and recording are covered.\n   - Notification or alert to operators upon alarming conditions, beyond just beep sounds, might not be fully covered.\n\nConclusion: The specifications lack a notification to the operator beyond the beeping sounds, which is an action incompleteness.",
