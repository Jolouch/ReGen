Spec 2 includes the designation of whether the unit is for heating or cooling. Both specs address the general request of controlling units and designating which unit (heating or cooling) is involved. This suggests all extracted function points seem partially covered by the given specifications. It appears to be S2 (implied absence).",

Still, one possible incomplete action is the absence of feedback or acknowledgment once the request is made to ensure the request was successfully initiated and executed.",
