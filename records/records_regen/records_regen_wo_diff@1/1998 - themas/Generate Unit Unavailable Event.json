Spec 2 covers the description of the event type and the designation of the thermostat, which resolves function points 3 and 4. However, there is no explicit specification related to identifying or using information that the request is denied before generating the event.\nThus, this implies an S1 situationâ€”there exists a functional point or aspect clearly not resolved in the specifications.",
