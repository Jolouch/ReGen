The spec 2 provides definitions related to temperature settings. The spec 3 explains how to recognize if the temperature exceeds limits and outputs that condition, covering function points 1 and partially 2. However, none of the specifications address function point 3, which involves the output of temperatures that do not exceed the limits for further processing. It is the S1: there exists a function point that is not resolved by the current specifications.",

It belongs to action incompleteness because it lacks a necessary operation.",
