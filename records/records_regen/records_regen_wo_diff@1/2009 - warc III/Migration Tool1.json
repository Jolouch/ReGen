Provides a migration workflow with a user-friendly API and a single header file. 2. Explicit configuration is mandatory and errors are generated if configuration is absent. 3. Conversion-related metadata can be input by the user or automatically generated.",
                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness\nThe spec 1 provides a clear API to handle migration, covering some aspects of function point 1, but it does not explicitly mention a single header file. The spec 2 requires a single header file, entirely addressing that part of function point 1. The spec 3 mandates explicit configuration and error generation, covering function point 2 comprehensively. The spec 4 allows user-provided metadata related to conversions, addressing part of function point 3.\nWe suspect that most points are handled aside from the automatic generation of metadata, implying S2: all function points seem resolved but require further specificity or coverage in certain areas.",

There is no additional condition to consider; however, the automatic metadata generation is implied but not detailed. The lack of specification on automatic generation indicates an action incompleteness because it lacks details on one of the actions specified in the function description."
