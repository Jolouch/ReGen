From this, the fine-grained function points are:\n1. Enable view of various data.\n2. Support report creation and review.\n3. Support report integration.\n4. Incorporate PDF files into reports.\n5. Save reports in different formats.",

Therefore, it is the S1 situation: an explicit absence of specification for incorporating PDF files into reports.",

This is a branch coverage incompleteness because it lacks a situation that should be considered.",
