Let's infer from potential operation sequences:\n- One logical operation could be verifying user privileges when renumbering bridge keys, as mentioned in the description ('contingent on user privileges'), but not explicitly defined in specs.\n\nThis suggests an implied absence related to branch coverage concerning user privilege verification before allowing renumbering.",
