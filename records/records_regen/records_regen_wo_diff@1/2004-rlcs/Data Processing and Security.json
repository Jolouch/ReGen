Log the results of the verification.",

Function point 1 is resolved by spec 1.\n2. Spec 2 provides for periodic verification that 'Message Digest' values match development records. Spec 3 specifies the frequency as at least once a day. Function point 2 is resolved by specs 2 and 3.\n3. Spec 4 records the verification results in the system log. Function point 3 is resolved by spec 4.\nAll function points appear to be addressed by the current specifications, indicating it may be an S2 scenario.",

This detail pertains to action incompleteness since a necessary response action is missing if 'Message Digest' verification fails.",
