GUI requests for status updates respond within 2 seconds, minus network/device delays. 3. Control commands from GUI respond within 2 seconds, excluding network/device delays. 4.

The specification for facility map refresh lacks details regarding its adjustability based on database settings. This missing detail forms branch coverage incompleteness since it involves an unconsidered situation of adjustable refresh rate.",
