The spec 2 describes re-requesting status if not received, addressing function point 3. However, specification 2 fully resolves function point 1, since it involves retrying unresponsive requests. \nThere's no explicit absence in the main function points, so it seems like an S2 case.",

Reviewing action steps, perhaps a missing action could involve notifying an operator about the failed requests during retry processes. This is not about generating a new request alone but aware of continuous failures. The incompleteness is action incompleteness regarding alerting relevant system operators when retries occur."
