Lead driver establishes a radio connection among multiple active traction vehicles without wire connections.\n2. 'Multi-drivers' indicator displays on all cab radios during ongoing communication.\n3. Lead driver receives notifications if a member places the call on hold, without affecting remaining members.\n4. Lead driver can remove members from the call.\n5. Lead driver can terminate the call.\n6. Lead driver is responsible for reestablishing the call if it fails in the lead vehicle.\n7.
