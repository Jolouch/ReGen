The spec 2 addresses the function point 2 (call continues until terminated by the calling driver, an authorised controller, or the network). The spec 3 resolves the function point 3 (audible and visual indication if train exits call area). The spec 4 covers the function point 4 (audible indication if call cannot connect).\n\nAll function points appear resolved by the current specifications. It is the S2 situation since no explicit absence is obvious.",

We need to consider hidden situations or insufficient actions.\n\nUpon review, no further hidden conditions emerge besides already covered ones. An audible indication is specified if a call cannot connect, but no visual counterpart is mentioned. This indicates an action incompleteness regarding the visual indication for unconnected calls.",
