The spec 3 connects calls to the loudspeaker when the handset is not in use. The spec 4 provides visual indication of ongoing broadcast calls on MMI. However, there is no specification regarding the connection of calls to the handset when it is off the hook. So it is the S1: There exists a function point clearly not resolved.",
