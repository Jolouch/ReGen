Show functional identity to the controller, which includes necessary information like train number or engine number.\n3. Notify the driver audibly and visually upon call connection.\n4. Connect the call to the loudspeaker.\n5. If unsuccessful, inform the driver with indicators of the busy line or network issues.",

Hence, this situation is S2: implied absence.",

However, the requirement states to inform the driver of issues such as busy line or network problems if the call is unsuccessful. The current specifications do not specify providing particular indications for a busy line or network issues.\n\nThis suggests an implied action incompleteness where specific indications for busy line or network issues are not detailed.",
