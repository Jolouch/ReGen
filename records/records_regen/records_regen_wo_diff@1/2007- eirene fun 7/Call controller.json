The system should contact the destination and show its functional identity to the controller.\n2. The functional identity includes necessary information.\n3. Upon call connection, notify the driver audibly and visually.\n4. Connect the call to the loudspeaker.\n5.

It covers function point 1.\n- Spec 2 defines what the functional identity includes, partially covering function point 2.\n- Spec 3 provides audible and visual indications for successful call connection, as well as connecting the call to the loudspeaker, covering function points 3 and 4.\n- Spec 4 provides indications for unsuccessful calls, addressing function point 5.\n- However, function point 2 mentions the functional identity includes necessary information, but Spec 2 only specifies the inclusion of the train number, which may not encompass all necessary information.\n- Therefore, the situation S1 (explicit absence) applies because not all necessary information for functional identity is specified in current specifications.",

This is an action incompleteness, as there is an absent piece of information within the functional identity.",
