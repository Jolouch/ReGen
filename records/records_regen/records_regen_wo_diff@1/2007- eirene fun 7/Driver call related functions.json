Lifting the handset transfers sound to it and reduces loudspeaker volume. 3. Replacing the handset cancels the call or transfers communication back to the loudspeaker at its initial volume. 4. A Push-To-Talk function is available for group calls.",

Spec 2 addresses function point 2 but doesn't mention reducing loudspeaker volume. Spec 3 addresses function point 3, but the aspect of transferring back to the loudspeaker at its initial volume is covered. Spec 4 addresses function point 4. Thus, function point 2 is not fully resolved, indicating S1: explicit absence.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince S1 is chosen, proceed to Step 3.1. The absence relates to the missing action of minimizing the loudspeaker volume when the handset is lifted. This is an action incompleteness.",
