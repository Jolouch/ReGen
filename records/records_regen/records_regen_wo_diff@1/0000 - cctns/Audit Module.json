Automatically track and store events after activation of audit trail functionality.\n2. Retain audit trails for the duration of a case's lifetime.\n3. Ensure data availability for inspection upon request.\n4. Export specified case trails.\n5. Capture access control violations including unauthorized access attempts and validly attempted violations.",
                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness\n- Spec 1 handles the tracking and storing of events after activation, addressing function point 1.\n- Spec 2 deals with retaining the audit trail for the necessary duration, addressing function point 2.\n- Spec 3 ensures data availability for inspection, addressing function point 3.\n- Spec 4 covers exporting specified case trails, addressing function point 4.\n- Spec 5 captures access control violations, focusing on unauthorized access attempts, addressing part of function point 5.\n\nUpon examination, it appears that the specifications address most function points. Nonetheless, the function description specifies both unauthorized access attempts and validly attempted violations. Specification 5 only explicitly mentions denied access attempts. Therefore, this might indicate an implied (S2) absence as function points seem fully resolved, but detailed deficiencies remain.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince we are dealing with an S2 situation, we need to investigate if there are any hidden situations or necessary actions missing.\n\nReviewing the specifications, there's an oversight regarding 'validly attempted violations.' While Spec 5 covers denied access attempts, it lacks clarity on how 'validly attempted violations' are handled, thus, indicating an action incompleteness for validly attempted violations.\n\n'Validly attempted violations' implies situations where access control is technically breached (e.g., bypassing basic security measures) but not explicitly unauthorized, needing to be flagged or stored differently."
