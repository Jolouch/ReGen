No explicit conditions were overlooked, and function points are addressed.\nHowever, considering the operation sequence might provide new insights. The function description emphasizes quick and efficient communication, but there is no mention of how the system ensures this efficiency, such as through real-time alerts or notifications.\nAction incompleteness may exist regarding the systemâ€™s method of ensuring messages are swiftly expedited or confirmed. This is critical for achieving the specified effectiveness in communication.",

To bridge this gap, generating a specification regarding real-time alert mechanisms is appropriate."
