Correct answers lead to the next question. 3. Incorrect answers prompt a retry without scoring. 4. Critical plot direction changes based on the user's answer at certain points. 5. Once a set number of questions have been completed, the user is directed to the ending scene.",

Specification 3 covers plot direction changes at critical points. Specification 4 ensures the user is directed to the ending scene after completing a set number of questions. It appears all function points are at least partially covered. Thus, we are dealing with situation S2, where function points seem to be covered, but there might be deficiencies in detail or implicit omissions.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness. Since we are in situation S2, we must look for hidden situations or insufficient actions in the specifications. Upon close examination, it appears that while responses to correct and incorrect answers are considered, the specification does not outline the system behavior for correct answers, aside from leading to the next question. There is no specification indicating acknowledgment or reinforcement of correct answers, which could be important for user feedback. This suggests action incompleteness, as acknowledging correct answers is omitted.",

To address the absence of acknowledging correct answers, a new specification should be generated: The system should display a positive acknowledgment message when a correct answer is chosen, to reinforce the user and encourage continued participation."
