Indicate any non-operational periods of the DH System.",

Spec 2 addresses point 2 about daily temperature and humidity values. Spec 3 addresses recording security breaches, resolving point 3. However, there is no specification addressing point 4 regarding non-operational periods of the DH System. Therefore, this is an S1 situation: there exists a function point clearly not resolved.",

This translates into a branch coverage incompleteness due to the lack of coverage for this particular situation.",
