The driver can select Train Data Entry on the DMI. 3. Data can be entered manually or automatically, but manual entry is only possible when stationary. 4. The driver can consult train data anytime. 5. Data is stored in ETCS equipment until inoperative. 6. Data must be confirmed by the driver at Data Entry start.",

The spec 1 resolves function point 1, spec 2 resolves function point 2, specs 3 and 4 resolve function point 3. However, spec 5 indicates data consultation only when stationary, contradicting the function description which says any time, creating a divergence. Specs 6 and 7 resolve function points 5 and 6. There seems to be an incompleteness as not all aspects of function point 4 have been satisfied, leading to an S1 situation.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness. According to Step 3.1, the incompleteness arises not just from the difference in stationary conditions but the lack of a specification to allow consultation anytime, not just when stationary, as described in the function description. This constitutes a branch coverage incompleteness as there's a lack of situation covered where train data should be consulted when not stationary.",
