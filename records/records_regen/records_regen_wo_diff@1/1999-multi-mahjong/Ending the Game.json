Spec 2 details the user's ability to end the game at any time and choose subsequent actions. Spec 3 covers server updates to clients about game end and subsequent options. However, there is no specification about replacing a user with a Computer Opponent (CO) if they leave early. This leads to Situation S1: a functional point is clearly not addressed in the specifications.",
