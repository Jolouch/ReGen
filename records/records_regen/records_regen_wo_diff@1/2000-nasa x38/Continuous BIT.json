Continuous BIT integrates with Redundancy Management and Scheduler operations, executing within a 50Hz rategroup.\n2. Continuous BIT execution takes less than 2ms under nominal conditions and less than 3ms when processing faults.\n3. Continuous BIT operates on the FCP virtual group.\n4. Continuous BIT resets the processorâ€™s watchdog timer at 50Hz; failure to do so within the allotted time generates a processor reset.",

This falls under S1.",

This is a type of branch coverage incompleteness because it's a missing situation addressing the increased time frame when processing faults.",
