Define maximum message size and incoming message buffer limits through create and open API calls. 3. Return an error if enqueue space is insufficient. 4. Sockets are non-blocking and require application tasks to handle polling.",

However, the function point regarding defining the maximum message size through create and open API calls is not explicitly covered in the current specifications.\nThis is the S1 situation where there exists a function point that is clearly not resolved.",
