Spec 2 focuses on determining if the job can meet the deadline but does not mention budget criteria. Spec 3 outputs the result as a boolean value (accepted or rejected). Therefore, the function point 1 regarding determining satisfaction based on job parameters (both budget and deadline) is partially resolved. This suggests S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved.",

It belongs to branch coverage incompleteness because it lacks consideration of a necessary situation (budget fulfillment).",
