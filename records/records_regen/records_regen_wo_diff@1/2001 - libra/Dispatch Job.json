Decides on which node the job will be placed for execution.\n2. Decides on which queue the job will be placed for execution.\n3. Scheduler takes the job and inserts it into the queue on the execution host to join the competition.",

Joining the competition for resources (related to function point 3).\n\nThe function point 2 regarding \"decides on which queue the job will be placed for execution\" is not clearly addressed by any of the specifications. Therefore, it is the S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved.",
