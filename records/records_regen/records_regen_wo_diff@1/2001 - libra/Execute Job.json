Allocation of CPU time slices to jobs based on the stride-scheduling algorithm. 3. Selection of jobs with minimum pass value for execution. 4. Advancement of the pass by its stride for the executed job.",

Specification 2 resolves function point 4 by advancing the pass by its stride. Specification 3 resolves function point 1 by repeating the loop until no jobs are left. However, the allocation of CPU time slices based on the stride-scheduling algorithm (function point 2) is not explicitly resolved in the current specifications. This falls under S1 since there is a function point clearly not resolved.",
