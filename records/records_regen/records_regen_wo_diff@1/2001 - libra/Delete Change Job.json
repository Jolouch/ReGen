Spec 3 addresses changing job and updating scheduling decisions. The function points related to user permissions and job cancelation seem to be resolved by spec 1 and spec 2. However, specific circumstances under which parameters can be changed, especially 'delayed deadline' and 'output directory,' are not explicitly addressed in the specifications. Therefore, it is S1: There exists an explicit absence regarding the changing of job parameters.",

The incompleteness is the lack of specifications explicitly detailing the conditions or parameters that can be changed, such as allowing specification of a different output directory or a delayed deadline. This belongs to branch coverage incompleteness because it involves specifying conditions under which parameter changes are allowed.",
