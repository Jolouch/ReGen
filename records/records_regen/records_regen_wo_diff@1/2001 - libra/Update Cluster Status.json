The spec 2 updates the execution host queue status when a job is scheduled for execution or removed. Therefore, the function points seem to be resolved: resources are reserved before scheduling, and queue status is updated when scheduling or removing a job. It indicates implied absence (S2).",

All situations appear resolved given both starting and ending job states are addressed. 2. There appears to be no action incompleteness at first glance. \nLet's use the operation sequence for further insights: Since the operation sequence is not provided, it cannot influence decision-making.\nHowever, during the transition between jobs (state change), there could be a need for temporary logging or escalation in priority if resource thresholds are approached, which are not covered in the original specifications."
