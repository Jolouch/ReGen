                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness\nThe spec 1 addresses data backups. The spec 2 mentions warnings for multiple failed login attempts. The spec 3 deals with allowing only valid users to log in. The spec 4 describes configurable timeout for user logout.\n\nEach specification appears to map correctly to each function point. There's no clearly unresolved function point (no S1). This indicates an implied incompleteness (S2).",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nAnalyzing S2, we must determine if hidden situations or insufficient actions exist. No unconsidered conditions appear. Reviewing the function points and specifications together reveals no omitted actions necessary for valid login, system warnings, or logout behavior.\n\nHowever, there's an implied action incompleteness related to alerting the System Administrator. The function description specifies alerting by email, yet current specs only state 'warn about failed attempts'. This is an action incompleteness because the mode of alert (via email) is unaddressed.",
