Maintains comprehensive schedules. 3. Allows users to add or edit agreement terms based on access level. 4. Supports setting periodic or ad-hoc submission schedules. 5. Manages and monitors submission volumes. 6. Keeps an audit trail. 7. Users' actions are influenced by access level permissions.",

Spec 2 allows editing of agreement terms, which covers function point 3. Spec 3 addresses setting submission schedules meeting point 4. Spec 4 manages and monitors submissions aligned with point 5. Spec 6 keeps audit trails, addressing point 6.\n\nUpon this review, the specifications do not explicitly mention user access level permissions affecting actions (specifically related to adding or editing agreements, and potentially influencing other functions), hence it's S1, an explicit absence.",

The uncovered functional point relates specifically to how usersâ€™ access level permissions interact with system capabilities. This points towards a lack of consideration for branch coverage as it pertains to access levels and potential restrictions based on those levels.",
