View various data (bridge, project, preservation model, simulation results, configuration).\n2. Generate predefined reports.\n3. Support report creation and review.\n4. Integrate PDF files into reports.\n5. Save reports in different formats (PDF, HTML, XML).",
                "#step2: Step 2: Locate the incompleteness\nAnalyzing each specification:\n- Spec 1 allows users to view various bridge-related data through predefined reports, resolving function point 1.\n- Spec 2 allows report creation and review through a specified report generator, addressing part of function point 2 and function point 3.\n- Spec 3 provides integration with the report generator, indirectly addressing function point 3 but not explicit about PDF integration.\n- Spec 4 allows for saving in different formats, addressing function point 5.\n\nIt appears function point 4 (PDF integration) is partially resolved. Specs 2 and 3 do not specifically address the integration of PDFs directly in the report creation or review processes.\nThis indicates an S1, as the explicit action of PDF integration during report creation/review is not entirely covered.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince we're dealing with S1, let's focus on step 3.1.\nThe specific incompleteness is related to the absence of a comprehensive specification to cover PDF integration during the report creation/review process in sufficient detail.\n- The operation sequence indicates actions surrounding custom report generation and PDF integration (points 3 and 4) that are not explicitly covered in the current specs.\nThis absence points towards action incompleteness, where the action to integrate PDFs into reports during creation/review phases needs explicit addressing.",
