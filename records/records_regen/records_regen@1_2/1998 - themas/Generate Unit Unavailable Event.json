The operation sequence also mentions logging purposes, which implies a need for proper recording.",

The function point 1 is resolved by spec 1 and 2. However, the operation sequence indicates 'use the event for logging purposes,' suggesting the need for explicit specification regarding event recording or logging, linking to function point 3. It seems like S2 because all points appear covered superficially, yet the operation sequence hints at potential incompleteness in action.",

The action of recording the generated event seems implicitly absent in the specifications, hence action incompleteness due to lack of explicit recording/logging operation."
