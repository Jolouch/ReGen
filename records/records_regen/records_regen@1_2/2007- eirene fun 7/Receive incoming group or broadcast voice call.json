Additionally, a visual indication on the MMI should inform drivers of ongoing calls.",

Specification 2 covers displaying the group identity. Specification 3 addresses connecting calls to loudspeakers when the handset is not in use. Specification 4 resolves the need to inform the driver of ongoing calls via the MMI.\nThe operation sequence suggests another action: connecting calls to the handset when it's off the hook. This action is not present in the current specifications. This qualifies as situation S1, where an explicit functional point is not resolved in the provided specifications.",
                "#step3: Step 3: Detect the specific incompleteness.\nSince the incompleteness is from S1, we directly identify that the specification lacks the explicit action to connect calls to the handset when it is off the hook. This is an action (object) incompleteness, as there is a missing functional behavior.",
