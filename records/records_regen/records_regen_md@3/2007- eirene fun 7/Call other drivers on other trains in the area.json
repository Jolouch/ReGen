However, referring to the operation sequence, I noticed an 'authorized controller' or 'network' action for terminating the call as mentioned in spec 2, yet operation sequence item 3 lacks this dimension of call termination authority, focusing only on the initiating driver. Although the operation sequence focuses on the driver's actions, the specifications already cover the additional authorized enders (controller or network). This hints at a complete range of termination capabilities. Given the completeness of described actions and sequence relevance, no additional elements explicitly appear incomplete.",
