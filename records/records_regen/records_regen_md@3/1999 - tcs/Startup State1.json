However, the alert mechanism to operators as per the function description is partially addressed. The lack of direct mention of alerting the operator for executing beyond permitted levels leads to the realization of S2, where the function points seem covered but imply an absence.",

The operation sequence provides insight into alerting operators when executing actions beyond permitted interaction levels. Thus, there's an absence of a specification covering operator notifications about limitations, revealing action incompleteness.",

There remains the function point 6 regarding ensuring the operator is alerted during unauthorized functions, which seems linked to the operation sequence provided. However, for the purposes of this analysis, all specifications appear to resolve the function points. This leads to S2 where there seems to be no explicit incompleteness.",

However, evaluating the operation sequence does provide additional light on operator interaction through alerts. As in example 2, the specifications explicitly mention the prohibition of unauthorized interaction, but not the clear alert or acknowledgment mechanism.\nIn particular, the operation sequence action 'evaluate and adjust to the system's operational status during Recovery Startup Mode' is noteworthy. This suggests potential action incompleteness because it lacks emphasis in specifications for necessary adjustments or evaluations during Recovery Mode that should be a coherent addition."
