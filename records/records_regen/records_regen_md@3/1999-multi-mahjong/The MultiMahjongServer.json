Spec 3 describes architecture for CO. Spec 4 covers graphical interface for setting changes. Spec 5 discusses saving and reading preferences.\nFrom the operation sequence, it shows the need for reflecting changes in names and icons in real-time across all clients and offering log information, but only changes not directly linked to any specification.\nAll function points seemed resolved with current specifications.

This reflects an action(implied) incompleteness, needing detail on updating player statistics visually across clients.\nSpec 4 states providing a graphical interface for administrators but lacks mention explicitly about offering log information which is inferred from the operation sequence as necessary.",

However, the operation sequence suggests real-time updates to clients and log information provision. This could imply incompleteness.",

The operation sequence mentions reflecting name and icon changes in real-time across all sessions, possibly implying this function requires explicit specification.\n2. The mention of offering log information and having a graphical interface for logs isn't fully covered by just settings changes in Spec 4.\nThus, the incompleteness might be in either action or condition coverage. Further review leans towards action incompleteness specific to logs.",

Real-time chat is resolved by Spec 1.\n2. Real-time updates of names and icons seem referenced by Spec 2 but might lack details on reflecting changes across sessions (function point 6 and operation sequence 1).\n3.

Hidden situations?\n   - Reflecting changes across sessions is crucial for user experience.\n   - Offering log information is necessary for administration, especially if using a graphical interface.\n\n2. Action sufficiency?\n   - Reflecting in real-time across sessions: The operation mentions real-time reflection, indicating that full updates are not specified clearly.\n   - Log information: Operations suggest an absence of explicit specification on log management.\n\nInsights from the operation sequence guide us to realize an action incompleteness in proper reflection of name/icon changes across sessions, and the clear necessity for logging capabilities accompanying the graphical interface."
