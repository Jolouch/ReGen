Spec 2 resolves function point 2 by allowing the reading of current temperature. Spec 3 sets a temperature range, resolving function point 3, but it does not address the increment detail. All listed function points seem to be resolved in part by current specifications. It is the S2 situation because the focus on one-degree increments is implied but missing from the explicit requirements.",

The incremental change of temperature in settings is emphasized in the operation sequence but omitted in specifications. This is an action incompleteness because the specification lacks the crucial detail on how the temperature adjustment is supposed to occur. It seems reasonable to address the method of adjusting settings as it is reiterated in the sequence operations."

However, the function point related to 'adjust the thermostat settings in one-degree increments' is only partially resolved, as none of the specifications explicitly detail the increment capability.
