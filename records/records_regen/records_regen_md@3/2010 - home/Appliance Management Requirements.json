The spec 2 changes the power switch state, also changing appliance state. The spec 3 addresses manual state changes until the end of the period. However, the function point of reverting to default settings after the time period seems paraphrased in spec 3 but not fully expressed as it emphasizes only on manual changes being temporary. The ability to override default settings is mentioned but not a dedicated action. Situation S1 is identified because the full specification doesn't exist for reverting to default settings nor dedicatedly for temporary override ability.",

The description and specifications do not mention explicitly allowing users to override defaults temporarily, though they suggest manual overrides. The operation sequence refers to the temporary overriding capability clearly, implying an action incompleteness in user overrides. The system should permit users to override default settings without waiting until the end of the time period.",
