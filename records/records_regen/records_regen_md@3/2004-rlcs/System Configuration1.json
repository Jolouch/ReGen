Assign security levels and passwords to staff members. 5. User security levels assigned at commands and system functions.\n\nStep 2: locate the incompleteness\nThe spec 1 addresses the Configuration option's accessibility. The spec 2 allows modification of database tables. The spec 3 checks for conflicts before storing data. The spec 4 assigns security levels and passwords to staff. The spec 5 assigns user security levels at command level, device, mode, workstation, and system function. \n\nThe function point regarding the exception for log tables (point 2) is not explicitly resolved, as none of the specs mention prohibiting modifications on log tables. \n\nStep 3: Detect the specific incompleteness\nSince the function point about log tables is not covered in the specifications, it falls under S1 (Explicit absence). We proceed to Step 3.1.\nThe incompleteness is the absence of a specification to exclude modifications on log tables.\n\nStep 4: Summary and Generation\nBased on the requirement context and the absence of exclusion of modifications to log tables, generate a new spec: Modifications to logs tables are not permitted in the Configuration option."
