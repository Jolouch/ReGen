So it is the S2.",

After reviewing the specifications, while they mention batch validation upon saving and range checks during input, they miss any form of immediate real-time validation feedback during the input process itself. This is highlighted by the operation sequence that mentions real-time validation of data.\nNo branch coverage (situation) incompleteness seems evident currently, given the specs already present for batch and individual input conditions. However, the action of real-time validation with immediate feedback during the data entry step is notably absent. Given that the requirement description places emphasis on validation during input, lacking real-time action highlights an action incompleteness.",
