The absence detected through careful review involves incorporating PDF files into the reports; Specification 3 allows integration with compliant report generators, but it doesn't specify integrating the PDF files with the full display and embed functionalities, as mentioned in the operation sequence (particularly steps 4 and 6). This suggests action incompleteness, as integrating PDF content is implied to be a distinct supportive action for the report, providing more utility beyond just being part of integration."
