Action insufficiency: The operation sequence (Steps 5-7) suggests ignoring or not responding to invalid temperatures, which aligns with the idea of responding differently to invalid readings.\n\nThus, there's a possible action incompleteness here: the specification does not fully describe the handling of invalid temperatures beyond identification and status output.
