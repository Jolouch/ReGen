The operations and specifications do not mention any ordering of results aside from relevance, such as date or course level, which are often useful, especially because the operation sequence mentions filtering by a course level, date, or instructor. This oversight suggests an implied action incompleteness regarding the specification of results ordering. This is a reasonable absent action to include.",
