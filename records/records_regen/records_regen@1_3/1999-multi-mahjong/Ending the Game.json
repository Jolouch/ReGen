Users can exit or start anew at any point. 3. If a user departs early, a new CO takes their place. 4. MultiMahjongServer updates clients about game's end, offering quit or restart options.",

The spec 2 concerns the user's ability to end the game and subsequent options. The spec 3 deals with updated information to clients and offering options post-game. However, there's no specification addressing the action when a user departs early and a CO needs to fill in, which covers function point 3. It falls under S1: there exists a function point clearly not resolved.",
