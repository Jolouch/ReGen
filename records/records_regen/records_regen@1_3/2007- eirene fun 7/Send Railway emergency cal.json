                "#step2: Step 2: locate the incompleteness\nThe spec 1 allows for initiation of emergency calls, resolving function point 1. Spec 2 covers logging of activation, termination, and failures, thus resolving function point 2. Spec 3 provides for visual and audible alert for activation, partially resolving function point 3. However, function point 3 mentions alerts until termination, but there is no specification detailing behavior until termination. This indicates an S1 situation, with an explicit absence related to what happens until the call is terminated.",

The incompleteness is the absence of behavior specification for maintaining visual and audible alerts during the entire duration of the emergency call until termination, which is a branch coverage incompleteness because it is related to the situation of the ongoing call.",
