But the second function point about explicitly specifying the action (turning on or off) is not fully resolved as there is no specification that provides the designation of the action (turn on/off). Hence, it represents an S1 situation: explicit absence of a certain specification.",

This represents an action incompleteness since the detailed operation, specifying whether to turn on or off, is absent.",
