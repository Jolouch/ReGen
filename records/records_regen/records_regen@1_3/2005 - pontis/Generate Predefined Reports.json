Specs 3 and 4 discuss integrating selections and saving in various formats which cover parts of function points 3 and 4. \\nAt first glance, it appears all function points are potentially covered, pointing towards a S2 (implied absence).",

Reviewing specifications doesnâ€™t reveal any unconsidered conditions, so we look to operation sequence for new insights. \\nAnalyzing operation sequence, item 4 (integrate PDF and other file formats) appears central. Although spec 3 mentions integration, it doesn't specify integrating PDF which suggests a potential action incompleteness regarding specifics of PDF integration."
