The spec 2 clears data if the Cancel button is clicked. So function points 1 and 3 are resolved by spec 1 and 2. However, there is a discrepancy regarding point 2: the description states a warning when clicking cancel or close, but does not specify if it differentiates the data clearance between these two buttons.\nThus, it is S2, as function points appear resolved, but there is a latent ambiguity.",

This leads to an ambiguity in the required handling of data upon 'close'. There is no hidden situation yet noted beyond the requirements.\nFrom the operation sequence, which only has 'save data successfully,' no extra insights are found as it does not clarify the ambiguity directly.\nTherefore, the lack of differentiation in actions for 'close' vs 'cancel' when clearing data implies the potential deficiency."
