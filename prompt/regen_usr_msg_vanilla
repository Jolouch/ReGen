You are going to detect the incompleteness of the software requirement specifications and further generate new specifications.
The incompleteness means that the function specifications do not encompass all the information suggested or implied by the function description.
This will be based on the requirement context including function name, function description and function specifications.

software system: {topic}
function name: {function_name}
function description:
{function_description}
function specifications:
{function_specifications}

Now, review the above content and proceed to detect the incompleteness and further generate new requirement specification.

The final answer should be only one, in the format of
incompleteness: the detected incompleteness
new_specification: a specification (without index) related to the detected incompleteness without any other complete specifications.
